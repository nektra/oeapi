Building OEAPI from source code
--------------------------------------


Requirements
------------
* Visual Studio 2005.
* Windows Vista SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C2B1E300-F358-4523-B479-F53D234CDCCF).
* Lambdasoft Comet. Installer: http://www.lambdasoft.dk/files/comet_1b31.exe.
* Comet requires tlbinf32.dll (comes with Visual Studio 6, but not with newer Visual Studios). Installer: http://www.lambdasoft.dk/files/TlbInf32.exe.
* Comet update for Visual Studio 2005 (http://www.lambdasoft.dk/files/comet_vs2005.zip), unzip in a separate folder (ie: C:\Program files\Lambdasoft\comet_vs2005).


Visual Studio Setup
-------------------
* Add Comet folders to Visual Studio 2005 (Also explained on http://nektra.com/products/oeapi/comet.php).
 * "$(ProgramFiles)\Lambdasoft\Comet\bin" to Executable files.
 * "$(ProgramFiles)\Lambdasoft\comet_vs2005" (Comet update for VS 2005) to Include files.

* Add Windows Vista SDK's folders to Visual Studio (This should appear in first place, over the Comet paths).
 * "$(ProgramFiles)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin" to Executable files.
 * "$(ProgramFiles)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Lib" to Library files.
 * "$(ProgramFiles)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Include" to Include files.
 
 
Compiling
---------
* Open oeapi.sln within Visual Studio 2005 this should be in "%ProgramFiles%\OEAPI\Source".
* Compile all projects: Build/Batch Build/Select All -> Rebuild.


Testing
-------
* Close OE/WinMail if they are running.
* Kill launcher.exe installed with OEAPI setup program.
* Rename the key HKCU\Software\Nektra\Plugins to ensure there is no plugin loaded (same with HKLM\Software\Nektra\Plugins).
* Run launcher.exe from sources (should be compiled to "%ProgramFiles%\OEAPI\Source\Release\launcher.exe").
* Run OE/WinMail.
* You must be able to check that oecom.dll, oehook.dll, oeinitcom.dll are loaded inside OE/WinMail, using a tool like Process Explorer.


Known issues
------------
* Vista with UAC enabled doesn't allow the modification of files inside %ProgramFiles%,
so copy OEAPI's source files (the folder is "%ProgramFiles%\OEAPI\Source") to a folder that has
write permission (ie "My Documents").
* Platform SDK doesn't have some files required to compile OEAPI, ensure that you have
Windows Vista SDK installed.
* The original include files from Lamdasoft Comet are not added to the Visual Studio include path,
so you must use the files from Comet for Visual Studio 2005 update.


Problems
--------
If you have any problems compiling OEAPI send the exact output from Visual Studio in an
attachment to oeapi-support@nektra.com. Include:
* Visual Studio version number.
* Visual Studio service pack installed.
* Operating System version.
